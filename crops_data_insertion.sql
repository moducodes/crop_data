The brinjal is of much importance in the warm areas of Far East, being grown extensively in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China and the Philippines. It is also popular in Egypt, France, Italy and United States. In India, it is one of the most common, popular and principal vegetable crops grown throughout the country except higher altitudes. It is a versatile crop adapted to different agro-climatic regions and can be grown throughout the year. It is a perennial but grown commercially as an annual crop. A number of cultivars are grown in India, consumer preference being dependent upon fruit colour, size and shape."

Globally, maize is known as the queen of cereals because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider diversity of soil, climate, biodiversity and management practices that contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the global grain production. The United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of maize contributes nearly 35 % of the total production in the world and maize is the driver of the US economy. The USA has the highest productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1) which is double than the global average (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the average productivity in India is 2.43 t ha-1.

In India, maize is the third most important food crops after rice and wheat. According to advance estimate it is cultivated in 8.7 m ha (2010-11) mainly during Kharif season which covers 80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9 % in the national food basket and more than Rs. 100 billion to the agricultural GDP at current prices apart from the generating employment to over 100 million man-days at the farm and downstream agricultural and industrial sectors. In addition to staple food for human being and quality feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient to thousands of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages, food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper industries etc."

The average productivity of the crop is about 2,830 kg/ha.The crop is being cultivated both in Kharif (Sod) and Rabi (Vaigon) seasons, with an area of approximately 67 % and 33%, respectively. The average productivity of Rabi season is relatively higher as compared to Kharif season. The prevailing hot humid tropical climate and soil types varying from sandy loams to clayey types are ideal for rice cultivation. Average land holding size in Goa is relatively less (95% less than 1 ha) and that too fragmented.Further, the socio-economic situations prevailing in the state and non-availability and high cost of labour, lack of mechanization, threshing and processing facilities including marketing infrastructure are threatening the cultivation of this major food crop. The crop is cultivated in three different topographical situations i.e rainfed uplands (morod), rainfed low lands (kher) and coastal saline lands (Khazans)."
